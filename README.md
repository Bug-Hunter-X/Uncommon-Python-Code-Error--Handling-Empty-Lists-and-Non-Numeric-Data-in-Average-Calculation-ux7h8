This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Python:  handling edge cases when calculating the average of a list. The `bug.py` file shows the initial code with the error. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a robust solution that prevents `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError`.  The README provides details on the error and how the solution addresses it.
